AI Product Manager Portfolio
Welcome — this repository is the start of my **Product Management & Agentic AI (AI PM)** portfolio.
## About
I am building a portfolio that showcases my work, process, and deliverables related to AI product management: problem framing, product discovery, data & model considerations, stakeholder communication, metrics, and launch/monitoring plans.
## Projects (Examples)
- LLM feature rollout: problem definition, evaluation plan, UX mockups, and metrics
- Data pipeline design for model retraining and monitoring
- Experiment design and A/B testing for model-driven features

## What to expect in this repo
- Case studies and artifact files (slides, short write-ups, product specs)
- README per project explaining role, outcome, and key learnings
- Links to demo notebooks or prototypes when available

## How to use
1. Browse the folders for project case studies
2. Open `README.md` inside each project for context and artifacts
